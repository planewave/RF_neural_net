# Deep Complex-Valued Neural Networks 

For baseband wireless signal processing. A follow-up research of my thesis.
Can be used for other complex-valued (CV) signal processing.
Based on PyTorch framework.
Contributions are wellcomed.

## Objectives
* CV convolutional layers
* Activation, pooling etc. layers for CV neural networks
* Scaleable and rotatable convolutional layers
